#CarbonSource v0.0.2

CarbonSource is a website designed to help people better understand the politicians they vote for. We achieve this by allowing users to easily search through politicians, and view summaries of their views on various topics.

#The Politican Scorecard

Initial Requirements for Minimum Viable Product:

Objectives:

We can create a grading profile for each politician similar to the NRA's gun friendly grading site: https://www.nrapvf.org/grades/. We should probably then display the grade with what factors determined that grade, similar to a skillset(Example: Renewable Energy[50], Recycling[20]). Politicians can also be certified through sponsors such as the Rainforest Alliance. Relationships should be displayed such as Company A donated 50,000 to Senator Doe.

## General user stories:
* As a user, so that I can quickly input my search request, I should be able to easily submit my search request to a visible field.


* As a user, so that I can easily interpret the resulting data, I should be clearly presented with both visual and textual information relating to my query.


* As an advanced user, so that I can find what I am looking for more easily, advanced search options should be available.
(Should we allow db queries?)


* As a visually impaired user, so that I can also use the site, the site should be optimised for readers and colour blindness.


* As a user that is searching for data, so that I can easily access large amounts of carbonsource data, there should be an advanced search option to allow for large data amounts.


* As a maintainer, so that I can quickly submit large amounts of data to the scraper, the interface should be easy to use, and allow for quick submission of data.


* As a maintainer, so that I do not have to format resulting data, the parser should output data in a suitable format for easy manipulation and storage.
