#Company App/Website
* We have in our database information on three grocery store companies:
  * Company A has a high negative impact score because they freight in all of their produce from the other side of the world instead of sourcing local produce.
  * Company B has a neutral impact rating because they balance their carbon production by powering all of their stored by solar power.
  * Company C has a positive impact rating because they use solar power, only sell local, and do not sell plastic water bottles.
* With this information we allow the community to search for the closest grocery stores that has a positive impact rating.
* If none are found in the area, the user is provided a way to request or show interest in shopping at a grocery store like this. Data is collected and can be used to attract positive impact grocery stores in the users community.


#The Politican Scorecard

Initial Requirements for Minimum Viable Product:

Objectives:

We can create a grading profile for each politician similar to the NRA's gun friendly grading site: https://www.nrapvf.org/grades/. We should probably then display the grade with what factors determined that grade, similar to a skillset(Example: Renewable Energy[50], Recycling[20]). Politicians can also be certified through sponsors such as the Rainforest Alliance. Relationships should be displayed such as Company A donated 50,000 to Senator Doe. 

##Present Climate Change opinion/status of the following:

Big Political figures:

* President/VP
* US Congress

*** Goals

Present voters and users with evidence of politicians' opinion being bought.

## Methodology:

1. Identify information sources:
* Government sources  - voting record site, personal pages
* Twitter (tweets can provide valuable information - not only from the politican himself, but the tweets that they receive)
* Online Petitions (IF possible - gives perspective on issues of the candidates)

2. Build web scrapers to acquire relevant/interesting information

3. Compile this information into some schema

4. Render said information in a web app
