##Use Cases
###Use data collected to help a consumer easily find their local eco friendly grocery store as well as judge a politician based upon the 'eco-friendly' score

#Company App/Website
* We have in our database information on three grocery store companies:
  * Company A has a high negative impact score because they freight in all of their produce from the other side of the world instead of sourcing local produce.
  * Company B has a neutral impact rating because they balance their carbon production by powering all of their stored by solar power.
  * Company C has a positive impact rating because they use solar power, only sell local, and do not sell plastic water bottles.
* With this information we allow the community to search for the closest grocery stores that has a positive impact rating.
* If none are found in the area, the user is provided a way to request or show interest in shopping at a grocery store like this. Data is collected and can be used to attract positive impact grocery stores in the users community.

#Politician App/Website
We can create a grading profile for each politician similar to the NRA's gun friendly grading site: https://www.nrapvf.org/grades/. We should probably then display the grade with what factors determined that grade, similar to a skillset(Example: Renewable Energy[50], Recycling[20]). Politicians can also be certified through sponsors such as the Rainforest Alliance. Relationships should be displayed such as Company A donated 50,000 to Senator Doe. 

####To gather information we should probably look at a number of different ways such as:  
1. Scrape Politician's website  
2. Track expenditures and donations  
3. Scrape Wikipedia and other informational databases  
4. Utilize voting records such as http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm  

   
##TO DO  
1. Identify data sources, notate and rank importance 
2. Mock up a UI  
3. Find Sponsors
